# [NameCase](https://rubygems.org/gems/namecase)

https://rubygems.org/gems/namecase

## Description

NameCase is a Ruby implementation of `Lingua::EN::NameCase`, a library for
converting strings to be properly cased. This is good for converting
denormalized data to human friendly data.

## Example Usage

```ruby
NameCase("RON BURGUNDY")  # => Ron Burgundy
NameCase("MCDONALDS")     # => McDonalds
```

## Acknowledgements

This library is a port of the Perl library, and owes most of its functionality
to the [Perl version by Mark Summerfield](https://metacpan.org/release/SUMMER/Lingua-EN-NameCase-1.12). Any bugs in the Ruby port are my
fault.
